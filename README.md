# Project 1

### Feature Ideas
Features can be implemented independently as methods on the `Run` and `Runner`.

For participation:
- Experience metric (Brendan)
- Age: An estimate based on category and event date (Amiel)
- Penalize sailing, mud runs (Brendan)
- Average distance run
- If they usually finished but didn't finish last years (Amiel)
- Number of races of any kind. People who do more races seem to be more likely to compete in this one
- sequence of races

For finishing time:
- Trend of finishing times 
- average speed (for runs only) (Brendan)
- average distance 
- age


### Things to investigate

- Do people who run Ottawa also run Montreal
- Look for anomolies, investigate potential new features (Amiel) (weather, on grass etc)
- check if sex makes a difference

### Timeline

Over the weekend

- Amiel to update load data script to remove any date range you give it
- Amiel to add filtering on load that removes non-running events


### Notes

Cross validation doesn't make sense because of the chronology of the data.
