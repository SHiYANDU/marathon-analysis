1.To perform logistic regression, run logireg_exec.py (python logireg_exec.py)
2.The training data, test data and project data(for prediction) are loaded by 3 methods, they should be placed at the same directory with logireg_exec.py by method definition, if these data are placed in other folder, the path need to be changed
3.The program read project data with header row then drop it, as it does not keep a record for the runner's id, the data set should not be modified for the ordering to be correct
4.The program write the id and prediction in order to the file logistic_result.csv. This is a file with 2 column and the second column is the prediction. This is to be merged to the predictions.csv file.
